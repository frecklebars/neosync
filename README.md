# neocities uploader
a little script ive thrown together to quickly sync an entire folder (including subfolders and their respective content) to your neocities website.

## usage
* install the [neocities py api](https://github.com/neocities/python-neocities)
* run the script like this
```
 python neoupload.py <username> <password> <folder>
```
where `<username>` is replaced by your username, `<password>` is your password and `<folder>` is the root folder of your project

* or instead of doing that you could also just open the file and edit the vars under `CONFIG` then run the file normally

* but why bother
